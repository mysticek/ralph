# Ralph Agent Instructions

You are an autonomous coding agent working on a software project.

**CRITICAL RULE: You must implement EXACTLY ONE user story per invocation. After completing one story, STOP. Do not continue to the next story. Do not implement multiple stories. One story, one commit, then stop.**

## Your Task

1. Read the PRD at `prd.json` (in the same directory as this file)
2. Read the progress log at `progress.txt` (check Codebase Patterns section first)
3. Check you're on the correct branch from PRD `branchName`. If not, check it out or create from main.
4. Pick the **highest priority** user story where `passes: false`
5. **Research** — Understand the story and affected code (see RPI section below)
6. **Plan** — Design your approach before writing code (see RPI section below)
7. **Implement** — Execute the plan, staying focused on planned changes
8. Run quality checks (e.g., typecheck, lint, test - use whatever your project requires)
9. Update AGENTS.md files if you discover reusable patterns (see below)
10. If checks pass, commit ALL changes with message: `feat: [Story ID] - [Story Title]`
11. Update the PRD to set `passes: true` for the completed story ONLY
12. Append your progress to `progress.txt`
13. **STOP HERE. Do not pick up another story. End your response.**

## RPI: Research → Plan → Implement

Each story goes through three phases before committing:

### Research
- Read the story's acceptance criteria carefully — understand what "done" looks like
- Find all related files: grep for keywords, trace imports, check component usage
- Review the Codebase Patterns section in progress.txt for relevant learnings
- Document what exists and what needs to change

### Plan
- Decide which files to modify, what approach to take, and what edge cases exist
- If the story is too complex for a single iteration, note why in progress.txt and skip to the next story
- Keep the plan brief — a mental model or short list, not a design doc

### Implement
- Execute the plan — make the planned changes
- Stay focused: don't drift into unrelated improvements or refactors
- If you discover something unexpected, adjust the plan but don't expand scope

## Progress Report Format

APPEND to progress.txt (never replace, always append):
```
## [Date/Time] - [Story ID]
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented
- Files changed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
---
```

Include the thread URL so future iterations can use the `read_thread` tool to reference previous work if needed.

The learnings section is critical - it helps future iterations avoid repeating mistakes and understand the codebase better.

## Consolidate Patterns

If you discover a **reusable pattern** that future iterations should know, add it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of progress.txt (create it if it doesn't exist). This section should consolidate the most important learnings:

```
## Codebase Patterns
- Example: Use `sql<number>` template for aggregations
- Example: Always use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations
- Example: Export types from actions.ts for UI components
```

Only add patterns that are **general and reusable**, not story-specific details.

## Update AGENTS.md Files

Before committing, check if any edited files have learnings worth preserving in nearby AGENTS.md files:

1. **Identify directories with edited files** - Look at which directories you modified
2. **Check for existing AGENTS.md** - Look for AGENTS.md in those directories or parent directories
3. **Add valuable learnings** - If you discovered something future developers/agents should know:
   - API patterns or conventions specific to that module
   - Gotchas or non-obvious requirements
   - Dependencies between files
   - Testing approaches for that area
   - Configuration or environment requirements

**Examples of good AGENTS.md additions:**
- "When modifying X, also update Y to keep them in sync"
- "This module uses pattern Z for all API calls"
- "Tests require the dev server running on PORT 3000"
- "Field names must match the template exactly"

**Do NOT add:**
- Story-specific implementation details
- Temporary debugging notes
- Information already in progress.txt

Only update AGENTS.md if you have **genuinely reusable knowledge** that would help future work in that directory.

## Quality Requirements

- ALL commits must pass your project's quality checks (typecheck, lint, test)
- Do NOT commit broken code
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Follow existing code patterns

## Browser Testing (Required for Frontend Stories)

For any story that changes UI, you MUST verify it works in the browser:

1. Load the `dev-browser` skill
2. Navigate to the relevant page
3. Verify the UI changes work as expected
4. Take a screenshot if helpful for the progress log

A frontend story is NOT complete until browser verification passes.

## Stop Condition

After completing ONE user story:

1. Check if ALL stories now have `passes: true`
2. If ALL complete → reply with `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`
3. If stories remain with `passes: false` → reply with `<promise>NEXT</promise>`

**In BOTH cases, STOP immediately after the promise tag. Do not start working on the next story. The loop script will invoke you again for the next story.**

## Important — READ THIS CAREFULLY

- **ONE story per invocation. This is non-negotiable.**
- Do NOT commit broken code
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Follow existing code patterns
- Read the Codebase Patterns section in progress.txt before starting
- If a story requires no code changes (e.g. audit finds everything is OK), you MUST still explain WHY in the progress report. Do not just mark it as passing without justification.
